# What I learned
Built with React, this project provided valuable lessons in several key areas:

- **API Integration**: I utilized an API that offers detailed information about movies and series. This taught me how to query, manage, and display data on the user interface.
  
- **State Management**: Reactâ€™s state management allowed me to transfer and update data across components. I applied this functionality to manage ratings, lists, and averages.

- **User Experience (UX)**: I learned how to design intuitive user interfaces and the core principles of UX design, ensuring that users can easily browse, rate, and track content in the app.

- **Project Structure and Modular Code**: Through development, I gained insight into the importance of project and component modularity, which enhances maintainability and scalability.

- **Testing and Debugging**: I recognized the significance of testing and debugging during development, learning how to effectively test components and address issues efficiently.

These experiences have greatly boosted my confidence and efficiency in developing modern web applications, and deepened my understanding of using React in real-world projects.
